Overview:

The point of this site is to help sports betting hobbyists base their bets on the statistics and odds that matter most to them. Placing a bet can sometimes feel like closing your eyes and throwing a dart at the dart board. Most people have no idea what they are betting on or what is going to get them ahead of the betting curve. PlaceTheBet.net is meant to give the users a basis to begin their exploration into beating the house and winning bets.

First Steps:

This site begins its analytical journey with statistics from the NFL. Initially, the site will only contain predictions based on the offensive and defensive points for each NFL team in a given week. In comparing these stats to their opponent that week, the site will provide an estimated points outcome for that game. That is the first step in the design of this site, but the goal is to go much further.

Design:

Each week will display the games happening on a single page with each game on its own bootstrap card. This card will include the team city, name, and logo along with the “consensus” odds for that week, the offensive and defensive point stats and the predicted outcome for that game based on those stats.

What Makes PlaceTheBet.Net Different?

To my knowledge, a site like this does not exist. It places the power of statistical analytics into the hands of the hobbyist and gives them the confidence to place the bet. Not only does it provide a wealth of odds and statistics, but it also allows the user to choose what statistics matter to them, allowing the power of analysis to run wild.
